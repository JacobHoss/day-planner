# Day Planner

This program lays out the normal working hours for a business day. When a user inputs a task in an hour timeblock, then clicks the Save Icon, it saves that task in Local Storage. Therefore, when the user exits the program, or refreshes the page, the task will remain in the timeblock. 

There are past, present, and future classes to color the timeblocks according to the current hour. Try it out!
